## A few examples using Microsoft's Azure Kinect with OpenCV :thumbsup:

When running the CMake project for the first time, enable the `INITIALIZE_K4A_SDK` option in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
This will help initialize the [`Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK`](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK). This project assumes you have all the  [`Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK`](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK) dependencies.
